SYNOPSIS

    [The fit error from applying the optimal transformation. If the two point
     clouds match up, this will be small]

Given two sets of 3D points in numpy arrays of shape (N,3), we find the optimal
rotation, translation to align these sets of points. This is done with a
well-known direct method. See:

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_Procrustes_problem
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabsch_algorithm

We return a transformation that minimizes the sum 2-norm of the misalignment:

    cost = sum( norm2( w[i] (a[i] - transform(b[i])) ))

We return an Rt transformation to map points in set 1 to points in set 0.

A similar computation can be performed to instead align a set of UNIT VECTORS to
compute an optimal rotation matrix R by calling align_procrustes_vectors_R01().

ARGUMENTS

- p0: an array of shape (..., N, 3). Each row is a point in the coordinate
  system we're transforming TO

- p1: an array of shape (..., N, 3). Each row is a point in the coordinate
  system we're transforming FROM

- weights: optional array of shape (..., N). Specifies the relative weight of
  each point. If omitted, all the given points are weighted equally

RETURNED VALUES

The Rt transformation in an array of shape (4,3). We return the optimal
transformation to align the given point clouds. The transformation maps points
TO coord system 0 FROM coord system 1.

def sample_imager(gridn_width, gridn_height, imager_width, imager_height):
    r'''Returns regularly-sampled, gridded pixels coordinates across the imager

SYNOPSIS

    q = sample_imager( 60, 40, *model.imagersize() )

    print(q.shape)
    ===>
    (40,60,2)

Note that the arguments are given in width,height order, as is customary when
generally talking about images and indexing. However, the output is in
height,width order, as is customary when talking about matrices and numpy
arrays.

If we ask for gridding dimensions (gridn_width, gridn_height), the output has
shape (gridn_height,gridn_width,2) where each row is an (x,y) pixel coordinate.

The top-left corner is at [0,0,:]:

    sample_imager(...)[0,0] = [0,0]

The the bottom-right corner is at [-1,-1,:]:

     sample_imager(...)[            -1,           -1,:] =
     sample_imager(...)[gridn_height-1,gridn_width-1,:] =
     (imager_width-1,imager_height-1)

When making plots you probably want to call mrcal.imagergrid_using(). See the
that docstring for details.

ARGUMENTS

- gridn_width: how many points along the horizontal gridding dimension

- gridn_height: how many points along the vertical gridding dimension. If None,
  we compute an integer gridn_height to maintain a square-ish grid:
  gridn_height/gridn_width ~ imager_height/imager_width

- imager_width,imager_height: the width, height of the imager. With a
  mrcal.cameramodel object this is *model.imagersize()

RETURNED VALUES

We return an array of shape (gridn_height,gridn_width,2). Each row is an (x,y)
pixel coordinate.

This is a utility function used by functions that evalute some interesting
quantity for various locations across the imager. Grid dimensions and lens
parameters are passed in, and the grid points and corresponding unprojected
vectors are returned. The unprojected vectors are unique only up-to-length, and
the returned vectors aren't normalized by default. If we want them to be
normalized, pass normalize=True.

This function has two modes of operation:

- One camera. lensmodel is a string, and intrinsics_data is a 1-dimensions numpy
  array. With a mrcal.cameramodel object together these are *model.intrinsics().
  We return (v,q) where v is a shape (Nheight,Nwidth,3) array of observation
  vectors, and q is a (Nheight,Nwidth,2) array of corresponding pixel
  coordinates (the grid returned by sample_imager())

- Multiple cameras. lensmodel is a list or tuple of strings; intrinsics_data is
  an iterable of 1-dimensional numpy arrays (a list/tuple or a 2D array). We
  return the same q as before (only one camera is gridded), but the unprojected
  array v has shape (Ncameras,Nheight,Nwidth,3) where Ncameras is the leading
  dimension of lensmodel. The gridded imager appears in camera0: v[0,...] =
  unproject(q)

ARGUMENTS

- gridn_width: how many points along the horizontal gridding dimension

- gridn_height: how many points along the vertical gridding dimension. If None,
  we compute an integer gridn_height to maintain a square-ish grid:
  gridn_height/gridn_width ~ imager_height/imager_width

- imager_width,imager_height: the width, height of the imager. With a
  mrcal.cameramodel object this is *model.imagersize()

- lensmodel, intrinsics_data: the lens parameters. With a single camera,
  lensmodel is a string, and intrinsics_data is a 1-dimensions numpy array; with
  a mrcal.cameramodel object together these are *model.intrinsics(). With
  multiple cameras, lensmodel is a list/tuple of strings. And intrinsics_data is
  an iterable of 1-dimensional numpy arrays (a list/tuple or a 2D array).

- normalize: optional boolean defaults to False. If True: normalize the output
  vectors

RETURNED VALUES

We return a tuple:

- v: the unprojected vectors. If we have a single camera this has shape
  (Nheight,Nwidth,3). With multiple cameras this has shape
  (Ncameras,Nheight,Nwidth,3). These are NOT normalized by default. To get
  normalized vectors, pass normalize=True

- q: the imager-sampling grid. This has shape (Nheight,Nwidth,2) regardless of
  how many cameras were given (we always sample just one camera). This is what

The optimization routine generates hypothetical observations from a set of
parameters being evaluated, trying to match these hypothetical observations to
real observations. To facilitate analysis, this routine returns these
hypothetical coordinates of the chessboard corners being observed. This routine
reports the 3D points in the coordinate system of the observing camera.

The hypothetical points are constructed from

- The calibration object geometry
- The calibration object-reference transformation in
  optimization_inputs['frames_rt_toref']
- The camera extrinsics (reference-camera transformation) in
  optimization_inputs['extrinsics_rt_fromref']
- The table selecting the camera and calibration object frame for each
  observation in
  optimization_inputs['indices_frame_camintrinsics_camextrinsics']

This function knows to return 3 types of output:

- ALL the points observed by ALL cameras together (returned always)
- The points observed by only a specific camera, inliers only (returned if
  icam_intrinsics is not None)
- The points observed by only a specific camera, outliers only (returned if
  icam_intrinsics is not None)

ARGUMENTS

- icam_intrinsics: optional integer specifying which intrinsic camera in the
  optimization_inputs we're looking at. If omitted (or None), I return a single
  numpy array containing the points for all the cameras. Otherwise I return a
  3-tuple with this array in the first element, and the camera-specific arrays
  in the last two elements

- idx_inliers: optional numpy array of booleans of shape
  (Nobservations,object_height,object_width) to select the outliers manually. If
  omitted (or None), the outliers are selected automatically: idx_inliers =
  observations_board[...,2] > 0. This argument is available to pick common
  inliers from two separate solves.

- **optimization_inputs: a dict() of arguments passable to mrcal.optimize() and
  mrcal.optimizer_callback(). We use the geometric data. This dict is obtainable
  from a cameramodel object by calling cameramodel.optimization_inputs()

RETURNED VALUE

if icam_intrinsics is None: returns only the array containing ALL the points
observed by ALL cameras. Otherwise returns a tuple, with that array as the first
element:

- An array of shape (Nobservations, Nheight, Nwidth, 3) containing the
  coordinates (in the coordinate system of each camera) of the chessboard
  corners. These correspond to the observations in
  optimization_inputs['observations_board'], which also have shape
  (Nobservations, Nheight, Nwidth, 3)

- an (N,3) array containing camera-frame 3D points observed at calibration time,
  and accepted by the solver as inliers. Returned only if icam_intrinsics is not
  None

- an (N,3) array containing camera-frame 3D points observed at calibration time,

Given two polygons specified as a point sequence in arrays of shape (N,2) this
function computes the topological difference: all the regions contained in the
positive polygon, but missing in the negative polygon. The result could be
empty, or it could contain any number of disconnected polygons, so a list of
polygons is returned. Each of the constituent resulting polygons is guaranteed
to not have holes. If any holes are found when computing the difference, we cut
apart the resulting shape until no holes remain.

ARGUMENTS

- positive: a polygon specified by a sequence of points in an array of shape
  (N,2). The resulting difference describes regions contained inside the
  positive polygon

- negative: a polygon specified by a sequence of points in an array of shape
  (N,2). The resulting difference describes regions outside the negative polygon

RETURNED VALUE

A list of arrays of shape (N,2). Each array in the list describes a hole-free
polygon as a sequence of points. The difference is a union of all these
constituent polygons. This list could have 0 elements (empty difference) or N
element (difference consists of N separate polygons)

SYNOPSIS

    mapping_file_framenocameraindex = \
      mapping_file_framenocameraindex( ('img5-cam2.jpg', 'img6-cam2.jpg'),
                                       ('img6-cam3.jpg', 'img7-cam3.jpg'),)

      'frame7-cam3.jpg': (7, 1) }


Prior to this call we already applied a glob to some images, so we already know
which images belong to which camera. This function further classifies the images
to find the frame number of each image. This is done by looking at the filenames
of images in each camera, removing common prefixes and suffixes, and using the
central varying filename component as the frame number. This varying component
should be numeric. If it isn't and we have multiple cameras, then we barf. If it
isn't, but we only have one camera, we fallback on sequential frame numbers.

If we have just one image for a camera, I can't tell what is constant in the
filenames, so I return framenumber=0.

ARGUMENTS

- *files_per_camera: one argument per camera. Each argument is a list of strings
   of filenames of images observed by that camera

RETURNED VALUES

We return a dict from filenames to (framenumber, cameraindex) tuples. The
"cameraindex" is a sequential index counting up from 0. cameraindex==0
corresponds to files_per_camera[0] and so on.

The "framenumber" may not be sequential OR starting from 0: this comes directly
from the filename.

This function works with polylines represented as arrays of shape (N,2). The
polygon represented by such a polyline is "closed" if its first and last points
sit at the same location. This function ingests a polyline, and returns the
corresponding, closed polygon. If the first and last points of the input match,
the input is returned. Otherwise, the first point is appended to the end, and
this extended polyline is returned.

None is accepted as an empty polygon: we return None.

ARGUMENTS

- c: an array of shape (N,2) representing the polyline to be closed. None and
  arrays of shape (0,2) are accepted as special cases ("unknown" and "empty"
  regions, respectively)

RETURNED VALUE

An array of shape (N,2) representing the closed polygon. The input is returned
if the input was None or has shape (0,2)

def apply_color_map(array, a_min = None, a_max = None):
    r'''Color-code an array

SYNOPSIS

    image = produce_data()

    print( image.shape )
    ===>
    (480, 640)

    image_colorcoded = mrcal.apply_color_map(image)

    print( image_colorcoded.shape )
    ===>
    (480, 640, 3)

    print( image_colorcoded.dtype )
    ===>
    dtype('uint8')

    cv2.imwrite('data.png', image_colorcoded)

This is very similar to cv2.applyColorMap(); more flexible in several important
ways. Differences:

- Supports arrays of any shape. Most of the time the input is 2-dimensional
  images, but this isn't required

- Supports any input data type, NOT limited to 8-bit images like
  cv2.applyColorMap()

- Does not support MATLAB color maps. At this time only one color map is
  supported (the default Gnuplot color map). Other gnuplot color maps will be
  supported in the future.

The color map is applied to each value in the input, each one producing an RGB
row of shape (3,). So output.shape is input.shape + (3,).

The output has dtype=numpy.uint8, so these arrays can be output as images, and
visualized using any image-viewing tools.

At this time only one color map is supported: the default color map used by
gnuplot. Support for others will be added in the future.

ARGUMENTS

- array: input numpy array

- a_min: optional value indicating the lower bound of the values we color map.
  All input values outside of the range [a_min,a_max] are clipped. If omitted, I
  use array.min()

- a_max: optional value indicating the upper bound of the values we color map.
  All input values outside of the range [a_min,a_max] are clipped. If omitted, I
  use array.max()

RETURNED VALUE

The color-mapped output array of shape array.shape + (3,) and containing 8-bit
unsigned integers. The last row is the RGB color-mapped values.
